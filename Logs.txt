:- [Do] Can make a mechanism so that the player can select the enemy to shoot at
:- [Do] Enemies after a herd of enemies will detect the front enemies and wait for them, and go after 
		follwing them
:- [Do] Make bullet mechanics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									22 March 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Modifying the Collider of Enemies
:- Modifying the rotation of the turret code, as the turret always moves into the initial rotation where the enemy was located first, but the enemy is gone by now.
:- Overlapsphere giving false values

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									23 March 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Ditching Overlapsphere and going for a list of gameobjects and cycling positions to check whichever is nearest or within the turret radius.
:- Also the enemies were not spawning properly because they were being instantiated on origin at the point of the turret and within turret range, so when calling for reusing enemy object, the enemy was being activated first which led to it being detected and then being reloacted to other position. Yeah, that was it.
:- Making use of Rotating Turret Mechanism 2, calculating a value of difference of 3 makes the turret rotate properly for now.
:- [Working] Working on collecting the tower and moving it around.
:- [Working] Figure out new Action System

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									26 March 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Made the movement system using new input action controls.
:- [Working] Working on parenting and de-parenting the collected tower.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									04 April 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- [Working] Parenting and de-parenting the tower from the player
	(-) Apparently the trigger doesn't recognise the tower once it is coupled/child of, with the player
	(-) Making a byte controller, so that the tower isnt let go as soon as it is collected.
		[=] Having a byte to control tower status is more better to control.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									16 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Laser still does not works properly.
:- [Important] [Found Alternative] For checking if the enemy has left the perimeter, adding 2.8 to the radius check as the collider is of  	scale 2.6f on both x,z direction.
	[=] Also the enemy scale is 2f for x,y,z.
:- [Current] 2nd approach to detecting Enemy.
	(-) Checking if the enemy is within the radius by checking distance from the tower.
		[=] Keep a reference to the enabled enemies in a sript and keep checking the distance.
			{-} Performance cost.
		[=] Going with this approach for now, until better approach is made.
:- [Fixed] Laser being wonky when targeting an active enemy
	(-) [Fixed]The laser turned on but as soon as turning on, it is in the wrong direction.
		[=] Calling FixedUpdate before turning on the laser.
:- [Fix] Enemy Spawner.
	(-) If the total count of specific unit is exhausted in 1 run, and the next run is called, enemies will be taken from the current run.
		[=] The waypointCount never resets to 0. Also, they fking disappear while going to the castle.
:- [Fix] Not all the troops need to be instantiated at the beginning
	(-) Can make a level system.
:- [Optimize] Check if it is possible to not run FixedUpdate everytime for the DrawLaser script.
:- Changing the way player collects the tower
	(-) As the trigger is already being checked, moving code there.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									17 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- [Do] Move the targeting laser to the top/another segment pointing the laser
:- [Do] Can use the line renderer for the laser shot at the enemies.
	(-) Define a specific length for the laser and then just update the start/tip of the laser, with adding the length to the line renderer as the end of the laser.
:- [Do] Draw area to show how much the turret can reach.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									19 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- [Do] Can make a shader to cut out the sides of the circle projecting out of the plane.
:- Perimeter Relationship -
	=> Sprite - 24.8 / Turret Range - 15
	=> Sprite - 28 / Turret Range - 17
	(-) y=1.5x+2.5, does the job for now.
:- Made a scope for the laser to come out of.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									21 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- [Do] Make Bullet Mechanism
	(-) As soon as bullet is instantiated, it will be launchec forward using AddForce.
	(-) When the bullet hits the enemy, OnTriggerEnter will detect if enemy, anf then call the damage function.
	(-) The current damage of the bullet will be stored in GameManager, so that when power-ups are collected, the damage can be set accordingly.
:- [Do] Show that the enemy has taken damage.
	(-) Some UI clue.
:- [Do] Make a common UI to show health for enemies or the tower.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									28 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- The stats canvas always faces the camera.
:- [Do] Decide Shoot INterval.
:- [Do] Make better system for bullet management
	(-) Making a pool of bullets for now. Using that pool to get a bullet without the need to instantiate new ones.
	(-) [Do] The bullet pool can be modified, accordingly to the powers which the player has. So, no need to instantiate every kind of bullet at once in the beginning.
:- [Do] Check if the bullet hits the enemies.
:- [Do] Adjust bullet speed.
	(-) Setting Bullet speed to 150 for now.
	(-) Changing back to 130.
:- [Do] Make different stats for different units.
:- Reset bullet velocity after hitting enemy.
:- [Fixed For Now] OnTriggerStay gets skipped certain times for picking up tower.
	(-) Update picks up the key press.
		[=] Setting a counter instead of checking in the OnTriggerStay.
		[=] Moved code to update, OnTriggerStay will only turn counter on, rest everything will be on update.
:- [Fixed For Now] Tower Controls to disable when picked up/put down
	(-) Tower keeps shooting if picked up while shooting.
	(-) Tower does not shoot again once piicked up and put down.
	(-) Reset tower stats when picked up/put down.
:- [Do] Reset Soldier stats once they reach castle.
:- [Fix] Gun keeps shooting once the enemy is dead.
	(-) Under CheckWithinPerimeter2, checking whether the enemy is active or not. If not active then skipping the enemy.
:- [Important] [Do] Decide enemy waves accordingly
	(-) [Do] Decide initial tower stats.
	(-) [Do] Decide Gameplay.
:- [Do] Make the bullets bigger.
:- [Do] Turret Controls :-
	(-) Make animation for Gun flash.
		[=] Only single big sphere to show bullet has ben shot?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									29 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Changing Bullet Mechanics
	(-) Not using rigidbody, instead using Transform.Translate instead.
	(-) Moving bullet detection to Enemy Controller instead.
:- [Fix] The bullets might collide with the ground.
	(-) They almost do collide at extreme sides, but can be forgiven..
:- Adding colliders at edges, so that player does not falls over.
:- [Fix] player cannot go over to the next platforms.
	(-) Fix bridge, no curved bridge
	(-) Plain bridge with only 1 box collider.
	(-) Changing player collider to capsule collider.
:- Player Movement
	(-) Not using velocity on player, but using Translate.
		[=] Original moveSpeedmultiplier is 12, changing to 0.5.
		[=] Translate seems better option and is smooth for now.
		[=] [Fix] Translate ignores the colliders set so that player does not fall.
		[=] If player falls from platform or bridge, player goes through the platforms and just pops up.
	(-) [Current Fix] Reverting back to AddForce, but using Impulse instead.
		[=] Increasing drag to 5 on player's rigidbody.
		[=] Changing moveSpeedmultiplier to 2.
	(-) The player floats if crossing the curved bridge.
:- [Done For Now] Make controls according to the floating joystick.
	
:- UI
	(-) As this is mainly for mobile..
	(-) [Done For Now] Joystick at the bottom of the screen?
		[=] Keeping Floating Joystick for now.
			(+) Changing text of interact to "Pick Up"/"Put Down" accordingly.
			(+) Changing color of the interact button to red/cyan accordingly.
			(+) Instead of Prompt, we get button to be enabled.
	(-) [Done For Now] Interaction button pops up to press, when interaction is to be done.
	(-) Making space for UI at the bottom.
		[=] Original camera stats
			(+) Vector3(0,47.4,-45.1) - position
			(+) Vector3(45,0,0) - rotation
			(+) 49.5 - size
			(+) 0.3 - near
			(+) 150 - far
		[=] Changing camera stats wont do jexkshyte.
			(+) Need to change spawn positions and make UI at the bottom just like this accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Making unique enemies.

	[ADVANCDED MECHANIC]
:- [Suggestion] Can make a barricade or gate or wooden blockade/wooden planks blockade before the Castle entrance.
	(-) Once enemy troops reach the gate, they will try to break the gate, chipping away at its health
	(-) The player would have to constantly look at gate's health also
	
	[ENEMY STATS]
:- Archers
	(-) Good mix of infantry / medium pace / average damage
	(-) 5 speed
	(-) 70 health
:- AirUnit1
	(-) fast pace / light damage
	(-) 8 speed
	(-) 30 health
:- Foot_Soldier_Spear
	(-) slow than medium pace / greater damage
	(-) 3 speed
	(-) 120 health
:- Foot_Soldier_Sword
	(-) +1 pace more than spear / -2,3 less damage than spear
	(-) 4 speed
	(-) 100 health
	
:- [Do] Decide initial stats for Cannon.
	(-) initial damage - 10
	(-) fire rate - 0.4
	(-) range - 20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Working on Area Highlight shader

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									05 AUGUST 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] Area Highlight shader

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									07 AUGUST 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Trying animations for enemies
	(-) AirUnit1 :- Instead of animating, maybe try to do this in script nly.
		[=] Script should be better
			{-} -36 to 36 in z, rotation.
		[=] Added simple fly animation with a little of bob up and down.
=> Creating separate classes for each enemy type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									08 AUGUST 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Done For Now] For highlighting the perimeter
	(-) Can use a circle sprite which moves up and down to show the area covered.
	(-) Original plan with transperant sprite around a cylinder would be better.
=> Making new Area_HighLight cylinder as the old one does not has good UV-unwrapping.
	(-) Equation for new cylinder :- y = 1.25x;
	(-) Moving Area_HighLight code from UI to GunControls, as we would be using a cylinder now.
=> [Do] Can remove the InvokeRepeating command of Area_HighLight to when it is called at the time of upgrade only.
=> Removing un-necessary box colliders from the turret.
=> Added Colliders to the up area also.
=> Disabling player collider, rigidbody, player controller, also gameplay UI
	(-) [Do] Enable back when the main gameplay starts.
=> [Do] Finish Main Menu
	(-) Changed Camera Stats:-
		[=] position :- Vector3(-12,26,18)
		[=] rotation :- Vector3(53.6,-5,0)
	(-) Gave player a book
	(-) Can create a controller for tower to randomly rotate in different directions to show that its scanning the environment.
		[=] Doing this in the GunControls.
		[=] EnableTurret will be false by default, until the game starts.
		[=] Works for now.
=> [Do] When player presses "Play", lerp the camera position from "Main Menu" to "Gameplay".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									08 AUGUST 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> [Do] Making Main Menu
	(-) Lerping camera from MM to MG.
	(-) Animating the in-between for character and if necessary turret.
=> Animating book being kept down.
	(-) Animating drawer
		[=] Drawer original position - -9.67x
		[=] First popping the drawer out -> book goes inside -> cover closes -> drawer withdraws
		[=] Changing pop out speed to 3 for both drawer and cover, pop in speed to 3.5 for drawer.
=> Lerping Camera
	(-) Immediately lerping to orthographic view would not be good, looks janky.
	(-) Changing to orthographic view from the start.
	(-) Lerping size as well. og size - 49.5
	(-) Works well for now.
=> Intro sequence seems to be over for now!!



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

												MAIN IDEAS
										------------------------
=> [Do] Need to make a progression system
	(-) The levels start out easy, and then gets complex.
=> [Do] Tower upgrade system.
=> [Do] UI
	(-) Main Menu
		[=] Have the player sit idly while the turret shoots enemies passing by one at a time in random intervals.
	(-) Gameplay
	(-) (BAD IDEA) Can have both in the same scene
		[=] play animation for the player to get up and take turret to initial position.
		[=] Animation system cna prove to be problem.
			{+} position, rotation values will lock for the player.
