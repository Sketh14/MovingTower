:- [Do] Can make a mechanism so that the player can select the enemy to shoot at
:- [Do] Enemies after a herd of enemies will detect the front enemies and wait for them, and go after 
		follwing them
:- [Do] Make bullet mechanics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:- Modifying the Collider of Enemies
:- Modifying the rotation of the turret code, as the turret always moves into the initial rotation where the enemy was located first, but the enemy is gone by now.
:- Overlapsphere giving false values

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									23 March 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Ditching Overlapsphere and going for a list of gameobjects and cycling positions to check whichever is nearest or within the turret radius.
:- Also the enemies were not spawning properly because they were being instantiated on origin at the point of the turret and within turret range, so when calling for reusing enemy object, the enemy was being activated first which led to it being detected and then being reloacted to other position. Yeah, that was it.
:- Making use of Rotating Turret Mechanism 2, calculating a value of difference of 3 makes the turret rotate properly for now.
:- [Working] Working on collecting the tower and moving it around.
:- [Working] Figure out new Action System

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									26 March 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- Made the movement system using new input action controls.
:- [Working] Working on parenting and de-parenting the collected tower.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- [Working] Parenting and de-parenting the tower from the player
	(-) Apparently the trigger doesn't recognise the tower once it is coupled/child of, with the player
	(-) Making a byte controller, so that the tower isnt let go as soon as it is collected.
		[=] Having a byte to control tower status is more better to control.

:- Laser still does not works properly.
:- [Important] [Found Alternative] For checking if the enemy has left the perimeter, adding 2.8 to the radius check as the collider is of  	scale 2.6f on both x,z direction.
	[=] Also the enemy scale is 2f for x,y,z.
:- [Current] 2nd approach to detecting Enemy.
	(-) Checking if the enemy is within the radius by checking distance from the tower.
		[=] Keep a reference to the enabled enemies in a sript and keep checking the distance.
			{-} Performance cost.
		[=] Going with this approach for now, until better approach is made.
:- [Fixed] Laser being wonky when targeting an active enemy
	(-) [Fixed]The laser turned on but as soon as turning on, it is in the wrong direction.
		[=] Calling FixedUpdate before turning on the laser.
:- [Fix] Enemy Spawner.
	(-) If the total count of specific unit is exhausted in 1 run, and the next run is called, enemies will be taken from the current run.
		[=] The waypointCount never resets to 0. Also, they fking disappear while going to the castle.
:- [Fix] Not all the troops need to be instantiated at the beginning
	(-) Can make a level system.
:- [Optimize] Check if it is possible to not run FixedUpdate everytime for the DrawLaser script.
:- Changing the way player collects the tower
	(-) As the trigger is already being checked, moving code there.

:- [Do] Move the targeting laser to the top/another segment pointing the laser
:- [Do] Can use the line renderer for the laser shot at the enemies.
	(-) Define a specific length for the laser and then just update the start/tip of the laser, with adding the length to the line renderer as the end of the laser.
:- [Do] Draw area to show how much the turret can reach.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									19 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- [Do] Can make a shader to cut out the sides of the circle projecting out of the plane.
:- Perimeter Relationship -
	=> Sprite - 24.8 / Turret Range - 15
	=> Sprite - 28 / Turret Range - 17
	(-) y=1.5x+2.5, does the job for now.
:- Made a scope for the laser to come out of.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									21 July 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- [Do] Make Bullet Mechanism
	(-) As soon as bullet is instantiated, it will be launchec forward using AddForce.
	(-) When the bullet hits the enemy, OnTriggerEnter will detect if enemy, anf then call the damage function.
	(-) The current damage of the bullet will be stored in GameManager, so that when power-ups are collected, the damage can be set accordingly.
:- [Do] Show that the enemy has taken damage.
	(-) Some UI clue.
:- [Do] Make a common UI to show health for enemies or the tower.

:- The stats canvas always faces the camera.
:- [Do] Decide Shoot INterval.
